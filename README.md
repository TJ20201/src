## How to add Credit
To add credit, add the [JavaScript file](https://tj20201.github.io/src/js/credit.js) (credit.js) to your website's credit page with a DIV element
that has an ID of "credits". In the "credits" DIV, the script will add the [icon](https://tj20201.github.io/src/img/srcicon.png) and name into the
DIV under a new element. If this works properly, your credits DIV will have this entry:<br>
[**SORRY, WE HAVE NO IMAGE YET.**]
